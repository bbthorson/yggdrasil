# Chapter 1 Script (6 Pages, 21 Panels)

## PAGE 1 (5 PANELS)

**PANEL 1**
> ENGINE ROOM - WIDE LENS VIEW
> Jack sits next to a cobbled together amplitude engine holding two wires together. The engine takes up the majority of the room and looks like an hourglass on its side with a large electromagnet on either end. Nothing seems to be happening.

**CAPTION:** Amplitude Engine sputters

**PANEL 2**
> ENGINE ROOM - FOCUS IS ON JACK’S WATCH
> Jack’s watch has multiple dials. It’s clearly well worn, with a distressed leather band and scratches on the face.

**JACK:** (top) Last day to make this jump
**JACK:** (bottom) if this piece of junk will ever fucking start

**PANEL 3**
> FULL HORIZONTAL PANEL - HALLWAY CONNECTING ENGINE ROOM TO COCKPIT
> We see the spaceship is not in great condition. The colors of the various metals are clearly different and piecemeal. We can only see one chair in the cockpit and it’s empty. Out the cockpit window appears to be lots of space traffic.

**PANEL 4**
> HALLWAY - FLIPPED ORIENTATION LOOKING FROM COCKPIT TO ENGINE ROOM
> Characters remain off panel.

**BEN:** Everything okay?

**PANEL 5**
> HALLWAY - ORIGINAL ORIENTATION
> Characters remain off panel.

**JACK:** Yeah…

## PAGE 2 (3 PANELS)

**PANEL 1**
> COCKPIT - LOOKING IN FROM HALLWAY
> Jack’s back to the reader, his hand on Ben’s shoulder. Now that we’re closer to the window, we can see the space traffic. It should have a western, steampunk vibe, but be clear that Jack’s ship is much worse off.

**JACK:** We talked about this, Ben. Everything is going to work out.

**PANEL 2**
> COCKPIT - BEN LOOKING UP AT JACK
> Ben’s face is stern, but defeated.

**BEN:** You don’t know that. You can’t.

**PANEL 3**
> HALF PAGE PANEL - COCKPIT
> Point of view is looking through the cockpit window towards our characters. Jack is sitting in his chair, swiveled towards Ben. Ben is looking straight forward.

**JACK:** (top) I know there's nothing for us down there. You've got a record now and I'll never make enough to pay off mom and dad's old debts. We won't ever be anybody back there.
**BEN:** What about our friends?
**JACK:** "Ben, buddy, you trust me right?"
**BEN:** Most of the time, yeah. I mean, I guess.

## PAGE 3 (3 PANELS)

**PANEL 1**
> HALF PAGE - COCKPIT
> Our view is inverted again, looking out into space from behind Jack and Ben. Space traffic is a little less sparse. Faint stars are dotted across the background.

**JACK:** What awaits us out there, it'll be like nothing you've ever dreamed of. The possibilities are LITERALLY endless! You just gotta trust me

**PANEL 2**
> COCKPIT - FOCUSED ON BEN’S FACE
> Ben looks overwhelmed. We can’t see Jack.

**BEN:** But there's no coming back…ever
**JACK:** (bottom) But we can always go forward. Forever.

**PANEL 3**
> COCKPIT - FOCUSED ON BEN’S BODY
> Ben is sitting more upright. His face looks slightly less concerned and is turned 30 degrees in the direction of Jack. We can’t see Jack.

**BEN:** Promise?
**JACK:** (bottom) Promise. Now start running your final electronics checks. I’ll go make the final adjustments to the amplitude engine.

## PAGE 4 (4 PANELS)

**PANEL 1**
> FULL HORIZONTAL PANEL - ENGINE ROOM
> Jack is leaning against the amplitude engine, hand on his forehead.

**JACK:** This is what you get when you rely on the low orbit garbage patch for electronics…

**PANEL 2**
> CLOSE UP OF WIRING SCHEMATICS
> An iPad-like screen has some funny language like “How To Build An Amplitude Engine For Dummies”. The IKEA-esque schematic looks clean and easy.

**PANEL 3**
> CLOSE UP OF JACK’S WIRING
> None of the wire colors match that of the schematic.

**PANEL 4**
> FULL HORIZONTAL PANEL - ENGINE ROOM
> Jack is holding a wire cutter and smirking.

**JACK:** Only time will tell

## PAGE 5 (4 PANELS)

**PANEL 1**
> ENGINE ROOM - TIGHT IN ON JACK
> Jack is sitting on the floor next to some loose wires looking confused.

**JACK:** Ben!

**PANEL 2**
> HALLWAY - WIDE ANGLE
> Ben isn’t visible.

**BEN:** Yeah?

**PANEL 3**
> ENGINE ROOM - WIDE ANGLE
> Somehow the engine room is even more of a mess

**JACK:** It's gonna be a few hours. Want to go make us some lunch?

**PANEL 4**
> HALLWAY - WIDE ANGLE

**BEN:** (top) A few hours?
**BEN:** (bottom) Yeah, sure

## PAGE 6 (2 PANELS)

**PANEL 1**
> ENGINE ROOM - TIGHT ANGLE
> Jack holds a wiring diagram next to one side of the amplitude engine. The two look more similar than the visual from PAGE 4

**PANEL 2**
> COCKPIT - LOOKING OUTWARD
> Ship has floated to be oriented at Earth, a pale dot in the distance.
