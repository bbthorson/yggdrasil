# `Empire of Time`

# `Book 1 - The Amplitude Engine`

## `Characters`

`Jack - Mid 30s. Short, messy hair. Wears a duster and boots with oil stains. An optimist.`

### `PAGE 1 - 5 PANELS`

1. `ENGINE ROOM - WIDE LENS VIEW`  
   `Jack sits next to a cobbled together amplitude engine holding two wires together. The engine takes up the majority of the room and looks like an hourglass on its side with a large electromagnet on either end. Nothing seems to be happening.`

   			`CAPTION`  
   	`Amplitude Engine sputters`

2. `ENGINE ROOM - FOCUS IS ON JACK’S WATCH`  
   `Jack’s watch has multiple dials. It’s clearly well worn, with a distressed leather band and scratches on the face.`

   			`JACK`  
   		`(chat bubble on the top of panel)`  
   	`Last day to make this jump`

   		`(chat bubble on the bottom of panel)`  
   	`if this piece of junk will ever fucking start`

3. `FULL HORIZONTAL PANEL - HALLWAY CONNECTING ENGINE ROOM TO COCKPIT`  
   `We see the spaceship is not in great condition. The colors of the various metals are clearly different and piecemeal. We can only see one chair in the cockpit and it’s empty. Out the cockpit window appears to be lots of space traffic.`

4. `HALLWAY - FLIPPED ORIENTATION LOOKING FROM COCKPIT TO ENGINE ROOM`  
   `Characters remain off panel.`

   			`BEN`  
   	`Everything okay?`

### `PAGE 2 - 3 PANELS`

1. `COCKPIT - LOOKING IN FROM HALLWAY`  
   `Jack’s back to the reader, his hand on Ben’s shoulder. Now that we’re closer to the window, we can see the space traffic. It should have a western, steampunk vibe, but be clear that Jack’s ship is much worse off.`

   			`JACK`  
   	`We talked about this, Ben. Everything is going to work out.`

2. `COCKPIT - BEN LOOKING UP AT JACK`  
   `Ben’s face is stern, but defeated.`

   			`BEN`  
   	`You don’t know that. You can’t.`

3. `HALF PAGE PANEL - COCKPIT`  
   `Point of view is looking through the cockpit window towards our characters. Jack is sitting in his chair, swiveled towards Ben. Ben is looking straight forward.`

   			`JACK`  
   		`(chat bubble at the top)`  
   	`I know there's nothing for us down there. You've got a record now and I'll never make enough to pay off mom and dad's old debts. We won't ever be anybody back there.`

   			`BEN`  
   	`What about our friends?`

   			`JACK`  
   	`"Ben, buddy, you trust me right?"`

   			`BEN`  
   	`Most of the time, yeah. I mean, I guess.`

### `PAGE 3 - 3 PANELS`

1. `HALF PAGE - COCKPIT`  
   `Our view is inverted again, looking out into space from behind Jack and Ben. Space traffic is a little less sparse. Faint stars are dotted across the background.`

2. `COCKPIT - FOCUSED ON BEN’S FACE`  
   `Ben looks overwhelmed. We can’t see Jack.`

   			`BEN`

   		`(chat bubble at the bottom)`  
   	`But we can always go forward. Forever.`

3. `COCKPIT - FOCUSED ON BEN’S BODY`  
   `Ben is sitting more upright. His face looks slightly less concerned and is turned 30 degrees in the direction of Jack. We can’t see Jack.`

   			`BEN`  
   	`Promise?`

   			`JACK`  
   		`(chat bubble at the bottom)`  
   	`Promise. Now start running your final electronics checks. I’ll go make the final adjustments to the amplitude engine.`

### `PAGE 4 - 4 PANELS`

1. `FULL HORIZONTAL PANEL - ENGINE ROOM`  
   `Jack is leaning against the amplitude engine, hand on his forehead.`

   			`JACK`  
   	`This is what you get when you rely on the low orbit garbage patch for electronics…`

2. `CLOSE UP OF WIRING SCHEMATICS`  
   `An iPad-like screen has some funny language like “How To Build An Amplitude Engine For Dummies”. The IKEA-esque schematic looks clean and easy.`

3. `CLOSE UP OF JACK’S WIRING`  
   `None of the wire colors match that of the schematic.`

4. `FULL HORIZONTAL PANEL - ENGINE ROOM`  
   `Jack is holding a wire cutter and smirking.`

   			`BEN`  
   	`Who the fuck gave you that flight plan?`

   	`We were almost torn apart.`

   			`JACK`  
   		`(chat bubble coming from the hall)`  
   	`Doesn’t really matter now, does it?`

3. `COCKPIT - FOCUS IS ON A 3D RADAR ON THE CONTROL PANEL`

   `BEN`

   `We almost got ripped apart by a super giant planet! Who the fuck misses that?`

   

   `JACK`

   `Maybe an unpredictable nova? Doesn't matter.`

### `PAGE 4 - 1 PANEL`

1. `FULL PAGE PANEL - INTERIOR OF COCKPIT`  
   `We’re looking down at a 3D projection of a moon. The moon appears to have deep crevices, as if liquid once flowed on it. On one edge of the screen is the edge of the large planet. On the other edge, some diagnostics appear with “Chance of Prehabitation: 22%” bolded for the reader.`

### `PAGE 5 - 3 PANELS`

   	`Absolutely ZERO organic compounds.`

2. `CLOSET SIZE ROOM - FOCUS ON JACK`

   			`JACK`  
   	`Listen, it’s just one moon in this system. We can run a deeper scan and see if there are more viable places for organic remnants.`

3. `CLOSET SIZE ROOM - FOCUS ON BEN`

   			`BEN`  
   	`Sure. Except you outfitted this ship to basically just jump to our destination.`

4. `FULL WIDTH PANEL - PANTRY/STORAGE AREA`  
   `We see a barren looking storage area.`

   			`BEN`  
   		`(chat bubble in between bare shelf space)`  
   	`And we’re going to starve to death in a few days if we can’t Sink to an organic planet.`

### `PAGE 8 - 6 PANELS`

*`Jack convinces Ben that they need to make their best calculation and hope that they end up near their destination. Jack doesn’t tell Ben that he damaged the Amplitude Engine and can’t accurately estimate how far they’re going to sink in. A heated explanation that the only way out is through. They can’t go back, all they can do is sink in and hope for the best. Odds are, they can keep sinking in until they come across a habitable planet. A quadrillion quadrillion eons.`*

   `Ben is holding a coupling device that looks like it should fit on the Amplitude engine`

   			`BEN`  
   	`Jack!`

   	`Why is the governor off the Amplitude engine?`

`NARRATIVE LEFT TO TELL - Ben wants to fight. Jack is insistent that it doesn’t matter and that they are on the ride of their lives. We really dig into the mechanics of how the Amplitude engine works and why Jack thinks they can keep jumping without aging.`

# `Book 2 - The Enzyme War`

## `Characters`

**`Story Structure`**

`Protagonist traveled forward as an experiment with her civilization not skipping time.`

`She finds she can't decode plant DNA.`

`Finds her species. Something is different.`

`[Journey]`

`Species had a subset that couldn't metabolize history. They used right wing like policies to create a post truth world. Reorganized society to keep them in power.`

`They can asexually reproduce, but there's genetic variations. Haven't figured out how to poison the timeline.`

`At one point I thought there should be 5 types of persons (pick any number) and play into Divergent like themes.`

`The remainder of the plot should involve guerilla tactics and the main character pretending to be oblivious.`

`Part 1 - propagandist trying to figure out what's going on.`

1. `Lands, orients`  
2. `We learn about enzyme history`  
3. `We get a very unbelievable story about why her enzymes aren't working`

`Part 2 - main characters become people who are using social control to try and keep order`

1. `Way back, issues in genetic variance puts civilization in peril`  
2. `Sexual reproduction outlawed`  
3. `Sympathetic view of their controlling society and a look at revolutions`

`Part 3 - resistance`

1. `Protagonist aligns with revolutionaries`  
2. `Revolutionaries carry out attacks, are caught and killed`  
3. `Revolutionaries are able to block asexual reproduction` 

# `Book 3 - The Verdant Throne`

## `Characters`

**`Story Structure (15-27 chapters)`**

`Story covers 3 nonsequential Regents rein. Each responsible for “trimming the timeline” a la Loki.`

`Crises created by visitors.`

* `First visitor is a different species. Verdant Throne doesn't know about time travel.`  
* `Second visitor is from the past, sent forward by an oppositional regent. Initial attack.`  
* `Third visitor(s) are essentially troops sent forward, which has become commonplace/expected.`

`End of this story is that losing Regents jump forward to attack at an unknown time. They must do everything they can to destroy tech advances before going forward.`
