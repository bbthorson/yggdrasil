# Story and Plot Details for "Untitled Book"

## The Central Conflict
The main conflict is between a specific pharmaceutical company, **Pharma**, and **the Church**. Pharma is creating GLP-1 medications that, as a side effect, sever the connection to "Alien DNA" in humans.

## Robert's Role
Robert, a promising PhD candidate, is lured away from his academic research by a lucrative job offer from Pharma, who has been tracking his work through his advisor. His time at the company is an elaborate, "Great Gatsby"-style distraction from his true potential. When Robert decides to leave the excessive corporate world and return to his PhD, he discovers that the vindictive company has had him expelled from his program. With his academic career in ruins, he reaches out to Sebastian for help.

## Sebastian's Master Plan
Sebastian recruits the now-disgraced Robert and brings him to the Vatican. His goal is to show Robert the full, uncomfortable truth: Pharma's shortsighted agenda and the Church's own manipulative control. He wants Robert to understand the true stakes and to help protect the "Alien DNA" mechanism from **all** threats, including potential corruption within the Church itself. Robert finds himself caught between two incredibly powerful and dangerous groups.

## The "Business Card"
The business card Sebastian gives Robert is a key plot device. It's not just a contact; it's a symbolic "key" that will eventually grant Robert access to the Church's inner sanctum and secrets.

## The Setting
The story is set in the near future, in a world where the influence of large pharmaceutical companies is immense and intertwined with global power structures.
