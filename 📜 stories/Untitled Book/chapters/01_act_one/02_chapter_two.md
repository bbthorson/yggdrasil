### Chapter Two - Inciting Incident

“Black eye, red,” Alice said on autopilot while twirling the priest’s business card between her thumb and middle finger.

The barista looked utterly confused. “She'll have a red eye, no milk or sugar. Make that two.” Robert clarified.

“Do you think it's a joke? Or maybe a riddle?” Alice asked to nobody in particular, still lost deep in her own thoughts and completely unconcerned with Robert or the barista at the moment.

“I don't know and it doesn't matter. You've got a mountain of papers to grade before tomorrow and I've got to write some module simulations that will undoubtedly fail. Give me the business card back and let's get to the library.”

“What's up dorks?” a familiar voice called out from behind them.

“Ugh, did you tell Blake we were getting coffee here today?” asked Alice.

“We get coffee here literally every Sunday. And no, why would I tell Blake anything? I don't talk to him.”

“Gonna ignore me? Whatever.” Turning his attention to the barista, Blake said “I'll have whatever they're having.”

The barista clearly didn't like Blake either.

“Blake, it's too early,” Robert started.

“Alice.” The barista called. “Alice,” she repeated after being ignored the first time. Robert grabbed the coffees.

“So you're telling me that this guy, Sebastian, ordered a Lyft on a phone you never saw, had you take him to Santa Fe, told you some weird lines about seeing former friends and not believing in God AND he's got business cards that say Catholic Priest?!”

“You've asked me this at least 5 times this morning. What makes you think I'm going to suddenly change my answer?”

“Blake.” The barista called monotonously.

“Wait, what!?” Blake said, leaving between Robert and Alice.

Robert looked at the barista. She was clearly over them. Robert grabbed the third coffee and let Alice know they couldn't work from the coffee shop today.

“Oh relax. We paid for the coffee, we can work here.” Alice objected, but Robert was already walking out the door. She followed, stomping her feet a bit dramatically.

“Where are you guys going?” Blake asked, following them out the door.

“You really have to stop inviting him to come work with us,” Alice snarked as they walked into a campus building.

“Alice…”

“I'm kidding! You're just always down these days and Blake’s our one true constant. And yeah, I know you think I should ease up on him, but how unbearable was he this morning?”

“I need to get some work done. Can we just ignore Blake for now?”

“I'm happy to ignore Blake forever.”

Roberts' eyes dashed over disapprovingly. “I'm going to the computer lab.”

“I'll come. I can grade papers there.”

“No, I really need to get some work done. I'm way behind.” He turned away from Alice and headed to the basement. The fluorescently-lit basement. The buzzing, fluorescently-lit basement. Maybe Alice was right. He had been down lately - he'd really lost his spark.

The computer lab was empty, just as he'd hoped. He logged into his university account, opened Chrome, and went to ResearchGate.
