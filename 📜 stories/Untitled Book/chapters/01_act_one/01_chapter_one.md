### Chapter One - World Building

The engine idled. Not with a reassuring purr, but a gasping closer to that of a drunk roommate with undiagnosed sleep apnea.

“This thing is such a piece of shit,” Robert muttered, staring at his phone mounted to the air conditioning vent with the third mount he’d bought off Amazon this year. Though nobody was around to hear, it was unclear which aspect of his surroundings he was referring to.

He rolled down the window. Manually.

He could barely hear the hum of a street light overhead, but he could hear it. He focused so intently on that hum, trying to use the power of his conscious mind to ignore the sound of his car. The harder he focused on the light, the more he heard the inconsistent patter of the engine.

How he longed for the unchanging hum of the streetlight.

His phone chimed. A ride, finally. 15 minutes away. Not ideal, but a ride nonetheless. He shifted into Drive and started forward - time to breathe a little life into his sputtering beater.

As he drove through the quiet streets, slowly rolling through every stop sign, he thought about all the chances he had to leave. Sure, hindsight is 20/20, but he felt like kicking himself for not recognizing every missed opportunity to get up and go until it was too late. It was as if he were trapped in this town.

Other people had cool stories about picking up famous actors who were in town shooting a movie or TV show in Albuquerque, but the only passengers he got were drunk teenagers trying to get home or people with worse cars than his who needed to get to work. Without fail, they all commented on how crappy his car was, and if they didn’t their tips surely did.

A stoplight. He knew this town and there was no traffic, but he still checked Waze to make sure there wasn’t a faster way. No luck, it looked like Google Maps was still fastest. 

As he switched back, he noticed his passenger looked quite old and formally dressed, a noticeable difference from his typical passenger. Not a big deal, but a bit surprising for a Saturday night. Also, the name - Sebastian - don’t see many of those these days.

As he approached the pick up area, the street was completely undeveloped. There was a lone bus stop, lit from above by street light that was undoubtedly humming with admirable consistency.

His phone rang. Alice.

“Not now,” Robert answered, “I’m just about to pick up a ride.”

“Should I make enough dinner for the two of us?” a voice called back, only to be hung up on.

Robert pulled up to the bus stop.

The man seated there had a long heavy coat on. It looked expensive, though Robert didn’t have any context for why. He didn’t know much about coats, even though he grew up in the high desert.

The man stood up and opened the rear passenger door. “Robert?” he inquired.

“Sebastian?”

The man slowly lowered himself into the car, pulling his long, heavy coat in. He paused for just long enough for Robert to feel a bit awkward before closing the door. Was he listening to the sound of the engine and wondering what kind of death trap he was getting into? It didn’t matter now, he was in and the meter was running.

Robert slid his finger across his phone screen, indicating he’d picked up the rider. Destination: Santa Fe. Fuck. At this hour? My god. That’s at least an hour each way.

“So, what’s in Santa Fe?” Robert asked.

The man made eye contact with him in the rearview mirror for a long time. His facial expression conveyed confusion, as if he was trying to come up with an answer.

“A meeting. Some old friends invited me. I don’t travel much these days, but I thought I won’t have many more opportunities to see these old friends, so I best make the trip.”

“So you flew in?” Robert couldn’t discern an accent. “Where’d you come from?”

“Rome. It’s not home, but it’s where I live.”

This was bizarre. The guy had no luggage and Robert picked him up miles from the airport with nothing around that bus stop for multiple blocks. The area was reminiscent of city planners that thought Albuquerque was the next Phoenix and over-built infrastructure before the housing bubble.

A notification appeared on screen. “You're a dick. -Alice”

“Did you leave a bag at the bus stop? Should I go back?” They weren’t ten minutes into the over an hour drive. Now was the time to turn around.

“No. Everything I need is in Santa Fe,” he responded monotonously, still looking at Robert in the rear view mirror.

Didn’t this guy have a phone to play Candy Crush or watch TikToks on? Robert really needed the money, but this was as bizarre a trip as he could remember, and the drive to Santa Fe was uphill, more stress than he wanted to put on his ailing chariot.

If he was going to be stuck in the car with this strange man, surrounded by pitch blackness parted only by their headlines and the rare traffic going in the other direction, Robert figured he’d try to get to know Sebastian a bit. Also, it didn’t help that his car stereo was stolen weeks earlier.

“So you have friends in Santa Fe?”

“Old friends.”

“How old are you talking?”

“Old as in former,” he said. “Though all of us are well on the way down the backside of the mountain we call life.” He smiled, ever briefly, and looked out the window.

Silence.

Robert was dumbfounded. This old man was going to visit people he didn't like? In Santa Fe? From Rome? On a Saturday at almost midnight? With no bags?

God damnit, he wished he had a working stereo. He dug in his sweatshirt pocket, feeling around for his airpods.

“Do you believe in God?” Sebastian asked.

“Pardon me?”

“God.” A long pause with no response. “I'm sure you're familiar with the concept.”

“Sure,” Robert responded appeasingly. Sebastian was the silent one now. “I guess what I mean to say is that I believe in or could believe in the deification of the external forces of determinism as a unified actor that we call God.” Jesus Christ, that sounded like a hack line from some Philosophy 101 paper Alice was grading over a PBR and microwave mac and cheese.

Sebastian turned his head in from the window, but looked down, not directly into the mirror as he has been. Robert much preferred the lack of eye contact, but the awkwardness of this ride continued to swell inside him.

After quite some time, Sebastian looked up, though his eyes were on the darkness ahead, not the rearview mirror. “What if I told you I am a priest?”

“I didn't mean to offend,” Robert interrupted.

“A Catholic priest,” Sebastian continued as if Robert hadn't spoken, “and that God didn't exist.”

Robert’s ~~selective~~ memories of all the times he could have escaped Albuquerque came charging back into his consciousness. Every time in his life that had led him to this car ride and not some other, less bizarre moment.

“That God and religion,” Sebastian continued calmly and consistently like a streetlight, muted by the sputtering of Robert’s consciousness trying to drown out this car ride, “are our collective response to the unanswerable conflict between free will and determinism.”

Sebastian’s eyes rose up to meet Robert’s in the rearview mirror. Robert’s screaming internal monologue of unaddressable regret came to a sudden halt.

The car was moving, but it felt at that moment as if time did not. If not for the noise of the car and the vibration of the road, he could have mistaken the ever repeating blanket of darkness for motionlessness.

Sebastian broke the silence, “that would be quite a statement from a Roman Catholic priest.” He smiled and looked out the window.

What the hell was going on? Robert thought.

They sat in silence, Sebastian gazing into the darkness and Robert staring at the descending minutes til arrival. Twenty more minutes to Santa Fe. Robert simultaneously couldn't believe how long this ride had been and how quickly it had already gone.

Fifteen minutes to go. There was a light glow of light pollution in the distance. As welcome a site as effort. Sebastian was still looking out the passenger side window, silent, motionless.

Five minutes to go. They were in town. Stop signs and stop lights, all begging to be run so that Robert could turn around and drive an hour south with nobody to cover the cost of gas or wear and tear. He sighed, thinking about this hamster wheel of debt he consciously climbed into when he went to grad school.

Two minutes. A weird, slightly disappointing outcome for the night, but at least a fun story to tell Alice.

Sebastian turned to face forward, readjusting his coat and reaching into the breast pocket. He pulled out a business card, handing it to Robert. “I cannot express my gratitude enough,” he started. “I can only imagine how inconvenient a trip like this must be, but the importance to me is nearly indescribable. I have very little in the way to give, but when the time comes, this card will open the right door.”

Robert looked down at the car when he stopped at the last stop sign before the drop off point. It was simple. White background, black text in a basic serif font. 

“Sebastian  
Catholic Priest”

“We're here,” Robert said, utterly confused as to what to say about the business card.

Sebastian opened the door, swung his feet out, turned back to look at Robert once more before exiting the car and very gently, but firmly, closing the door. He walked to a nearby bench and sat down.

—

Robert drove down the street a ways, until he was out of eyesight of Sebastian. He was hoping for another ride, somebody going back to Albuquerque would be perfect, but this was Santa Fe after midnight. Fat chance.

As he sat, waiting for his Hail Mary of a return fair, he fiddled with his power cord that never seemed to stay in and his phone mount that was always falling forward ever so slowly that he didn't notice til it fell off. After 15 minutes of waiting, he decided to bite the bullet and drive home. God clearly wasn't on his side.

He put in his airpods and dialed Alice.

“I didn't make you dinner,” the familiar voice answered.

“Sorry about that. You know how I get about riders. This car is already a disaster, I'm not trying to give anyone a reason to give me an even worse rating.”

“Sure, sure,” Alice responded, clearly uninterested in Robert's shame about his car. “When are you calling it quits tonight?”

“Funny you ask. I'm in Santa Fe.”

“Santa Fe!?” She interrupted.

“Santa Fe,” he continued, “and you won't believe this ride. If you didn't need a phone to request a ride, I'd tell you this guy didn't have one. He gave me a business card when he got out that just had his first name; no phone, no email, nothing.”

“Why the hell was he going to Santa Fe on a Saturday at midnight?” Alice asked, audibly more engaged than she had been initially.

“Alice, I wish that was the weirdest thing about this ride. He told me he was going to meet old as in former friends.”

“Uh, what?”

“Yeah, and he came from Rome. Italy. Said he was a Catholic priest.”

“Okay, I kind of believed you before that, but now I know you're full of it.”

“I swear. To. God. I've got his business card.”

“This is some twilight zone shit. You're really in Santa Fe?”

“Yeah. Heading back now.”

“Well, I gotta finish grading this paper and then I'm crashing. There's mac and cheese in the microwave for you if you're hungry. It's the good stuff too, made it in the crockpot with Velveeta cheese.”

“Thanks, Alice.”

“Don't mention it, just clean the crock pot when you get home.” She chuckled. “Drive safe, I'm out.”

The call ended.

Robert took out his headphones and was greeted by the familiar sound of the engine. “Back to Albuquerque, buddy,” he said as he patted the dashboard. The car was back in Drive and headed into the darkness once more.
