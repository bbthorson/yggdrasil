# Story Background: Mesabi Intergalactic

## The Core Concept
The story is a sci-fi novella told through the final audio log of Tom D., a veteran long-haul space navigator. These journeys, which are used when teleportation is too expensive, take decades. The navigators and crew are often born, raised, and die on these ships, knowing no other life. Tom is on his last run, aware that he will pass away from a terminal illness before the ship, the Mesabi Intergalactic, reaches its destination. He is recording his thoughts and memories as a legacy for the future generation of navigators he is helping to train, and to whom he is leaving his life savings.

## The Narrative Structure: Rules of Storytelling
We established a unique and strict format for telling this story to create a specific, immersive experience:

*   **Tom's Log is the Narrative:** The entire story is presented as a series of Tom's spoken audio log entries. The reader only experiences what Tom is present to record.
*   **Dialogue-Only Format:** The main body of the text consists only of dialogue spoken by the characters (Tom, Kepler, and any others).
*   **Cherry Provides the Context:** All descriptions, physical actions, background information, and even characters' internal states are conveyed through annotations provided by the ship's AI, Cherry.
*   **Objective Annotation:** Cherry's role is that of a clinical, detached observer. She does not interpret emotion. She reports objective facts: physiological data (a character's blood pressure spikes), physical data (the velocity of a thrown object), technical specifications, or the duration of a silence. The reader must infer the emotional context from this data.
