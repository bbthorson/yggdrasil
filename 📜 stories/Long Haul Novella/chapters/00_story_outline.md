# Novella Outline: Mesabi Intergalactic

This story is broken down into a three-part structure, with each part reflecting one of the core philosophical themes.

## Part One: Determinism (The Routine)

*   **Chapters 1-3:** We establish Tom's world. The mundane, repetitive nature of the long haul, his weary voice, the messy cabin, and the initial friction with the data-driven Kepler. The recurring false alarms on the ship are introduced.
*   **Chapters 4-5:** Foreshadowing. The alarms become slightly more frequent. Tom’s illness manifests in a small, private way (a tremor, a brief pain) that he doesn't mention in the log. The tension between Tom's intuitive "feel" for the ship and Kepler's restlessness grows.

## Part Two: Free Will (The Crisis)

*   **Chapters 6-7:** The Mistake. Tom's illness causes him to make a significant navigational error, resulting in a violent lurch. He lies about the cause, blaming it on an external event. Kepler is suspicious.
*   **Chapters 8-9:** The Confrontation. Kepler investigates the ship’s logs and discovers two truths: Tom lied, and the ship's couplings are systematically failing. He confronts Tom, and the argument is captured on the log. Using Cherry to bypass Tom's authority, Kepler proves he is right and takes command.
*   **Chapter 10:** The Choice. Kepler makes the command decision to decelerate the Mesabi. He knows this will save the ship and everyone on it, but it will also extend the journey beyond Tom's lifespan, sealing his fate.

## Part Three: Compatibilism (The Reckoning)

*   **Chapters 11-12:** The Discovery & The Anger. In the new, slower routine, Kepler investigates Tom’s biometric data and discovers his terminal illness. He is furious, feeling betrayed, and confronts Tom again. A tense, angry silence settles over the cockpit.
*   **Chapter 13:** The Turning Point. Tom, now mostly confined to his bunk, records a log entry about his childhood: seeing the comet for the first time as a lonely, bullied orphan. Kepler accesses the log and hears the story. His anger breaks, replaced by a profound understanding of the man he has been at odds with.
*   **Chapters 14-15:** The Comet. The dynamic shifts to one of quiet respect. Kepler begins trying to learn everything he can from Tom in his final days. In the final chapter, Kepler uses his command of the ship to perform a difficult maneuver, bringing the Mesabi close to that same comet. Tom, in his last log entry, describes watching it from an escape pod, his life's journey brought full circle by Kepler's deliberate act of grace—a moment where free will and fate ultimately meet.
