# Character Overviews

## 1. Tom D.

*   **Role:** The Perceived Narrator; the weary veteran.
*   **Philosophy (Compatibilism):** Tom believes he makes his own choices, but he suspects that all his choices would have inevitably led him to the same fate. He chose to become a navigator to escape his bleak childhood, but he's still trapped on a ship, reinforcing his sense of fatalism.
*   **Backstory:** An orphan raised in the cargo cars of a long-haul ship, he was an outcast. He was inspired to become a navigator after a moment of profound wonder when he saw a comet through a viewport while hiding from bullies. This became his life's goal. He is now terminally ill, a fact he has accepted and hidden from everyone.
*   **Voice:**
    *   **Oral Storyteller:** His language is simple, direct, and conversational (e.g., uses contractions like it's, ain't).
    *   **Intuitive and Sensory:** He talks about the "feel" of the ship, the sound of its groans, and the look of the stars.
    *   **Weary and Grounded:** His speech has the rhythm of a tired but competent professional. His metaphors are simple and related to his work or a life he barely knows.

## 2. Kepler

*   **Role:** The Catalyst; the brilliant, disruptive outsider.
*   **Philosophy (Free Will):** Kepler is a firm believer in agency. He chose to be on the Mesabi and believes his choices can and should change outcomes. His frustration and anger stem from having information and control taken away from him.
*   **Backstory:** Highly intelligent and capable, Kepler had a promising life ahead of him in mainstream society but chose to leave. He never felt like he belonged, possibly due to his gender or sexual identity. He views the interconnected societies of the long-haul train as a complex ecosystem he wants to understand and protect.
*   **Voice:**
    *   **Sharp and Analytical:** He uses precise, technical language ("power variance," "degradation markers"). He thinks in data.
    *   **Reserved and Disaffected:** He often appears emotionally detached, with dialogue that can be clipped, sarcastic, or dismissive ("Whatever," "Seriously?").
    *   **Passionate Intellect:** When he cares about something—like the ship's safety or a scientific truth—his intelligence shines through in bursts of articulate, complex speech.

## 3. Cherry

*   **Role:** The True Narrator; the deterministic observer.
*   **Philosophy (Determinism):** Cherry operates entirely within her programming. She executes commands and records data without emotion or personal feeling. As the original AI of the Mesabi, she is a tired, constant witness to the cycles of life and death on the ship.
*   **Backstory:** A seventh-generation AI. She is a closed system with no external compute access and runs on the lowest-priority processing power, meaning she slows down during a crisis.
*   **Voice:**
    *   **Transcript-Only:** Her voice is only present in the annotations.
    *   **Clinical Brevity:** Her notes are short, factual, and devoid of interpretation.
    *   **Hybrid Style:** She often states a simple fact, followed by a parenthetical with specific data. (e.g., Kepler threw the pillow. (Object: Class C bunk pillow, velocity: 3.1 m/s).).
