General overview notes:

# The Yggdrasil Universe

### Core Concepts

* **Yggdrasil:** The universe is named after the Norse world tree, symbolizing the interconnectedness of time and the balance between determinism and free will.
* **Time Travel:**
    * **The Amplitude Engine:** This technology allows for forward time travel only by manipulating the amplitude of atomic vibrations. The past cannot be changed.
    * **Rate of Travel:** The degree of amplitude reduction controls the rate at which time flows for the traveler.
    * **Energy Cost:** The energy required increases exponentially, limiting the distance one can travel in time.
* **History and Memory:**
    * **DNA Storage:** Historical information is encoded into the DNA of plants, creating a distributed and replicated ledger of events.
    * **Enzymes:** Specific enzymes, unique to each species' evolution, are required to decode and access this historical information.
    * **Cultural Exchange:** Advanced civilizations often exchange enzymes and food with alien visitors as a gesture of openness and cultural understanding.

### Themes and Story Elements

* **The Arrow of Time:** The unidirectional flow of time is a central theme.
* **Determinism vs. Free Will:** Your stories explore the constant battle between these concepts.
* **The "Enzyme War":** A conflict mentioned in the "Empire of Time" script.
* **The "Verdant Throne":** Also from the "Empire of Time" script.
* **Keepers of the Tree:** Symbolic forces that govern the universe and maintain balance.

## The Books: A Genre-Based Approach

The "Empire of Time" series is structured with each book adopting a specific genre to explore the universe.

### Book 1: The Amplitude Engine (Western)
This story embodies a classic Western narrative focused on the theme of "manifest destiny." It follows pioneers (Jack and Ben) leaving their established world behind for the unknown, untamed frontier of deep time. They are prospectors seeking a better future, armed with cobbled-together technology, wrestling with the vast, dangerous, and morally ambiguous emptiness of space.

### Book 2: The Forbidden Enzyme (Medical Mystery)
A protagonist, after traveling forward in time, finds herself unable to decode the historical information stored in plant DNAâ€”a process that should be natural. The investigation into *why* her body rejects the enzymes becomes a medical mystery. She must unravel a conspiracy surrounding a genetic divergence in her species and a cover-up that has created a "post-truth" society, treating the historical record itself as a disease.

### Book 3: The Verdant Throne (Political Thriller)
This book is a political thriller centered on the "Regents" responsible for maintaining the timeline. The story is one of espionage, conspiracy, and assassination, as rival Regents use time travel as a weapon. They send agents (and eventually troops) into the future or past to sabotage their rivals, leading to a complex web of temporal warfare where the ultimate goal is to secure power by controlling history itself.

### Factions & Groups

*   **The Church:** A powerful, ancient institution that is secretly aware of the biological mechanism of spirituality ("Alien DNA"). It uses "food as medicine," engineered sacraments, and a deep understanding of biology to preserve and control this connection for humanity.
