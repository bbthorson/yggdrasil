# Technology: The Amplitude Engine

This document details the core principles, mechanics, and rules governing the primary method of time travel in this universe.

## Core Concept

The Amplitude Engine's primary function is to allow for forward time travel over immense cosmological distances. It doesn't make a ship travel faster, but rather "freezes" or "pauses" the ship and its occupants in spacetime.

### The "Sinking In" Process
While the ship is paused, the rest of the universe continues to expand and move forward in time around it. This process is called "Sinking In." The visual effect for those inside is not of the ship moving, but of the entire universe accelerating away from them from every direction, as if they are "falling into a hole."

### Atomic Amplitude
The scientific principle behind it is the manipulation of "atomic amplitude," which is related to atomic vibrations. By lowering the amplitude of the atoms that make up the ship and its crew, the engine disconnects them from the normal flow of spacetime.

### Key Constraint
A critical rule is that the Amplitude Engine can only work when free of significant gravitational influence. Microgravity is acceptable.

## Engine Mechanics and Design

The engine's design is based on the "Hourglass Model" and the manipulation of a Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC).

### The Hourglass Model
The engine is shaped like an hourglass on its side. The narrow center contains the Bose-Einstein Condensate (BEC), which is the heart of the engine.

### The BEC Core & Particle Manipulation
The wider ends of the hourglass act as collectors and dispersers for a specific type of particle (either gravitons or neutrinos). These particles are concentrated and forced through the BEC in the center. This interaction alters their properties and, in turn, affects the ship, causing it to "Sink In."

## Rules and Limitations of Time Travel

1.  **The Timeline is Fixed:** Time travel is only possible forward. The past cannot be changed. The rate of forward travel is dependent on the ship's amplitude.
2.  **Exponential Energy Cost:** The degree of amplitude reduction determines how fast time moves outside the ship. However, it costs an exponentially higher amount of energy for every incremental step of amplitude reduction, creating a practical limit on travel distance.
3.  **Absolute Zero is Impossible:** It is impossible to reach an atomic amplitude of absolute zero.
4.  **Navigation is Deliberate:** A ship cannot steer while the Amplitude Engine is active. To change course, the crew must "surface" by returning to a natural amplitude, use conventional thrusters to reorient the ship, and then "Sink In" again. This makes travel a series of calculated jumps.
5.  **Natural Amplitude:** There is a baseline "natural amplitude" to spacetime, which could function like a "current" that travelers might have to fight against or use to their advantage.

## Unanswered Questions

*   **Stasis:** How exactly does the crew survive without aging or needing resources? Does the engine project a field that perfectly preserves them, or is there another mechanism at play?
*   **Timelines:** The timeline is described as "fixed." Does this mean there is only one single, unchangeable timeline, or could the act of time travel create branches that need to be managed or "trimmed"?
