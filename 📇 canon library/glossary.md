### Amplitude Engine

A device that enables forward time travel over immense cosmological distances. It functions by manipulating the "atomic amplitude" of a starship and its occupants, causing them to "Sink In" or pause relative to the normal flow of spacetime. While the engine is active, the universe continues to age and expand around the paused vessel. The engine's operation is constrained by gravity, requiring it to be used in areas of microgravity, far from significant gravitational wells.

### Alien DNA
A biological component in humans that is the basis for spirituality and other long-term potential. Its expression and accessibility can be influenced by external factors.

### The Norns
A mysterious, ancient group that acts as the keepers of the timeline. They are the original source of the "Alien DNA" in humanity and represent a higher power or a deeper level of the universe's mechanics.
